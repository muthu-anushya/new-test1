    <p>Why are Tuition important for students?
        Competition among students is sky-high these days.  Besides classroom learning, students often need a new studying style, in -depth explanations etc. from tuition class in order to stay on top.
        
        We are teaching from Class VI and Class X and making them to learn well.
        We are also taking efforts to  make students to study Abacus, Handwriting and other activities for fast calculations and make them a topper in their classes.
